                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> I was born in the Puget Sound area and have lived here all my life. I'm currently 24 and was previously studying Psychology at the University of Washington, but due to some complications, I ended up not pursuing that field. I then started working at Amazon and have been working here for around 2 years now, and because of that, I was provided the opportunity to enroll in the Correlation One program. Things I enjoy doing outside of work include watching anime/reading manga, going for walks, playing occasional video games, and trying out other new hobbies. My latest hobby that I have indulged in is custom keyboards, which is a very expensive hobby, but seeing as I don't spend too much money in other places, I feel a little less worried about buying components. I only have 2 keyboards that I have built and personally like, but I have several more coming over the course of this year and the next. I'll be sure to post photos of them as soon as I am done building them :D.</p>
