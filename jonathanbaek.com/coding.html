            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2> 08/04/2023 <p> Correlation One is actually the start of my coding career! Difficult to say as it's only the beginning of the road still, but I'm currently enjoying the course immensely. The teaching style and pace are right up my alley, alongside the content that it delivers. I didn't want to start this journey alone, so I invited a few coworkers/friends to join me along this journey to a both a better career path and new experience.</p> 08/11/2023 <p>Throughout my time so far in Correlation One, I feel as though I have learned a lot and applied those skills well into my projects. The class certainly provides enough of a challenge that I have to evaluate my options carefully, but is not impossible to the point where it feels like a insurmountable obstacle. I hope to learn more new tools I can use in my future work, as well as meet more intruiging people along the way.</p> 08/18/2023 <p>Things have started picking up, but currently still enjoying the course. The new challenges that arise along side things that I have learned in the past from elsewhere makes the course more engaging, especially alongside my fellow classmates. I'll have to keep on practicing more to really drill the information into my head, but I am very much looking forward to it.</p>
