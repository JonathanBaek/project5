           <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jonathan Baek. The purpose of this page is to give you a glimpse at my journey through coding, and a bit of information about myself. The first part of my website, “About Me”, will give you a summary of my 25 years on this planet, and will hopefully allow you to get to know me a little more. The section titled “My Coding Journey”, is about how I got started with coding/software development, as well as my thoughts on Correlation One so far. I hope you find this page at least somewhat informational, and feel free to reach out through the “Contact Me” option above!</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p > I was born in the Puget Sound area and have lived here all my life. I'm currently 25 and was previously studying Psychology at the University of Washington, but due to some complications, I ended up not pursuing that field. I then started working at Amazon and have been working here for around 2 years now, and because of that, I was provided the opportunity to enroll in the Correlation One program. Things I enjoy doing outside of work include watching anime/reading manga, going for walks, playing occasional video games, and trying out other new hobbies. My latest hobby that I have indulged in is custom keyboards, which is a very expensive hobby, but seeing as I don't spend too much money in other places, I feel a little less worried about buying components. I only have 2 keyboards that I have built and personally like, but I have several more coming over the course of this year and the next. I'll be sure to post photos of them as soon as I am done building them :D. As promised, here's an image of what I have acquired so far.</p>

            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2> 08/04/2023 <p> Correlation One is actually the start of my coding career! Difficult to say as it's only the beginning of the road still, but I'm currently enjoying the course immensely. The teaching style and pace are right up my alley, alongside the content that it delivers. I didn't want to start this journey alone, so I invited a few coworkers/friends to join me along this journey to a both a better career path and new experience.</p> 08/11/2023 <p>Throughout my time so far in Correlation One, I feel as though I have learned a lot and applied those skills well into my projects. The class certainly provides enough of a challenge that I have to evaluate my options carefully, but is not impossible to the point where it feels like a insurmountable obstacle. I hope to learn more new tools I can use in my future work, as well as meet more intruiging people along the way.</p> 08/18/2023 <p>Things have started picking up, but currently still enjoying the course. The new challenges that arise along side things that I have learned in the past from elsewhere makes the course more engaging, especially alongside my fellow classmates. I'll have to keep on practicing more to really drill the information into my head, but I am very much looking forward to it.</p> 08/18/2023 <p>Things have started picking up, but currently still enjoying the course.

            09/13/2023 <p>We've now just barely reached the halfway point, and I am proud of how far I have come. However, we are still not done yet and must keep on cruising along till the end. WordPress isn't the most difficult topic we've gone over by any means, but I don't particularly like it, and would much rather code manually. Javascript, on the other hand, is very interesting, and look forward to learning more about the subject.</p>
